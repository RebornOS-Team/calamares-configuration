# Requirements checking. These are general, generic, things
# that are checked. They may not match with the actual requirements
# imposed by other modules in the system.
requirements:
    # Amount of available disk, in GiB. Floating-point is allowed here.
    # Note that this does not account for *usable* disk, so it is possible
    # to satisfy this requirement, yet have no space to install to.
    requiredStorage:    5.5

    # Amount of available RAM, in GiB. Floating-point is allowed here.
    requiredRam:        1.0

    # To check for internet connectivity, Calamares does a HTTP GET
    # on this URL; on success (e.g. HTTP code 200) internet is OK.
    # Use a privacy-respecting URL here, preferably in your distro's domain.
    #
    # The URL is only used if "internet" is in the *check* list below.
    # internetCheckUrl:   http://example.com
    #
    # This may be a single URL, or a list or URLs, in which case the
    # URLs will be checked one-by-one; if any of them returns data,
    # internet is assumed to be OK. This can be used to check via
    # a number of places, where some domains may be down or blocked.
    #
    # To use a list of URLs, just use YAML list syntax (e.g.
    #
    # internetCheckUrl:
    #     - http://www.kde.org
    #     - http://www.freebsd.org
