# The configuration for the package manager starts with the
# *backend* key, which picks one of the backends to use.
# In `main.py` there is a base class `PackageManager`.
# Implementations must subclass that and set a (class-level)
# property *backend* to the name of the backend (e.g. "dummy").
# That property is used to match against the *backend* key here.
#
# You will have to add such a class for your package manager.
# It is fairly simple Python code. The API is described in the
# abstract methods in class `PackageManager`. Mostly, the only
# trick is to figure out the correct commands to use, and in particular,
# whether additional switches are required or not. Some package managers
# have more installer-friendly defaults than others, e.g., DNF requires
# passing --disablerepo=* -C to allow removing packages without Internet
# connectivity, and it also returns an error exit code if the package did
# not exist to begin with.
