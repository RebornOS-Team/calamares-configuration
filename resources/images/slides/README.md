# Slides

1. The images from `calamares-configuration/development/slides/original` are cropped and stored in `calamares-configuration/development/slides/cropped`.
2. The cropped images are put in slide backgrounds in `calamares-configuration/development/slides/template.odp`, text is added with the "OpenSans" font in Bold, and exported slide-by-slide as images in `calamares-configuration/branding/rebornos/images/slides`.
3. The slideshow configuration in `calamares-configuration/branding/rebornos/show.qml` is modified to include the slide names, like `images/slides/slide_11.jpg`
